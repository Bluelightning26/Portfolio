    <h4>Shalom 2024</h4>
    <p>Every year during the first weekend of August, my youth group goes on a retreat to the Shalom By The Lake Resort. The organizing team creates handbooks every year, each with a new cover and theme,  printed in black and white to use over the weekend. For 2024, I took on the responsibility of designing the cover for the theme of “Identity” relating to our identities in our faiths.</p>

The home page features a pineapple logo, account profile photo, buttons to upload/take a photo, and a search bar all in pastel yellow and light purple colours. Additionally there is large text reading 'Visualize your learning' followed by slightly smaller text reading 'Start by uploading an image or taking one!'">
      <h4>STEMToons</h4>
      <p>During HawkHacks 2024, my team worked on an AI application with the goal of making the process of learning more fun and engaging. By uploading  any document, handout, or slideshow, the application could then generate a short comic strip summarizing the content. For this project, I worked on the web and brand design throughout the 36 hr hackathon.</p>

      <h4>The Boreal Express</h4>
      <p>In July 2024, I was invited to participate in The Boreal Express; a hackathon hosted by Hack Club meant to bring 50 teens on a train across Canada. However, due to wildfires, the hackathon continued on a stationary train. Nonetheless, the experience was truly transformative and to commemorate the event, I created a gouache painting inspired by our train and British Columbia’s landscape.</p>
